    My name is <b>Michal Neoral</b> and I am a <b>researcher</b> at the Visual Recognition Group (VRG) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

    I am currently a <b>PhD candidate</b>, supervised by prof. <b>Jiří Matas</b> and Dr. <b>Jan Šochman</b>. My dissertation, which is now under review, focuses on dense pixel-level tracking in video, with emphasis on optical flow estimation, occlusion handling, and motion segmentation.

My broader research interests lie in long-term correspondence estimation, where I aim to develop robust methods that maintain temporal consistency across extended video sequences. Recently, I have also been working on efficient detection and classification techniques for fast processing of large-scale data, as part of the AISEE project.

During my PhD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Toyota Motor Europe, and I would like to sincerely thank them for their generous support throughout my doctoral studies.




    I am a second year computer vision and machine learning PhD student at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), Czech Republic. My supervisor is professor Jiri Matas.

The main topic of my PhD explores leveraging recent advances in zero-shot segmentation to improve recognition accuracy and robustness. I am also working on fine-grained classification of fungi. Previously, my research focused on learning with limited supervision in the following areas: image segmentation and test-time adaptation, model-assisted labelling for visual inspection of bridges and scene-text detection and recognition.

I am teaching labs for the ‘Machine learning and patter recognition’ course at CTU and I co-supervise multiple bsc/msc/high-schoold students.

During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the Technion (Chaim Baskin, Alex Bronstein),





    I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Visual Recognition Group at the Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague under the supervision of Professor Ondrej Chum and Associate Professor Giorgos Tolias, working on the topic of "Cross-Domain Learning with Limited Supervision".

I received my engineering degree from the School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the National Technical University of Athens, and a M.Sc. in Data Science and Information Technologies from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.




    I am a computer vision PhD student at Visual Recognition Group, Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Department of Cybernetics. Lukas Neumann is my supervisor.

My primary focus lies in the weakly-supervised 3D detection for autonomous driving. My current research is on 3D detectors weakly-supervised by temporarily consistent 2D cues. In other words, using only an off-the-shelf visual component, such as Mask-RCNN, to generate pseudo-ground truth 3D labels.

I graduated from the MSc programme in Cybernetics And Robotics at Czech Technical University with honours in 2024. My master's thesis, focused on the Weakly-supervised 3D object detection for autonomous driving, has received a Dean's Award.

In my free time, I do running, orienteering, bouldering and walking around the city. I also enjoy a cup of good coffee.
