    My name is <b>Michal Neoral</b> and I am a <b>researcher</b> at the Visual Recognition Group (VRG) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague.

    I am currently a <b>PhD candidate</b>, supervised by prof. <b>Jiří Matas</b> and Dr. <b>Jan Šochman</b>. My dissertation, which is now under review, focuses on dense pixel-level tracking in video, with emphasis on optical flow estimation, occlusion handling, and motion segmentation.

My broader research interests lie in long-term correspondence estimation, where I aim to develop robust methods that maintain temporal consistency across extended video sequences. Recently, I have also been working on efficient detection and classification techniques for fast processing of large-scale data, as part of the AISEE project.

During my PhD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Toyota Motor Europe, and I would like to sincerely thank them for their generous support throughout my doctoral studies.
