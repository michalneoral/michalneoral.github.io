<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Researcher and Developer</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
        <b>Czech Technical University in Prague</b><br>
        2016 -- present<br>
        As a researcher at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, I focused on computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence (machine learning). My work encompassed developing algorithms for visual perception, contributing to autonomous systems, and participating in collaborative projects with industry partners.<br>

        2025 -- present<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Project: <b>Toyota Lab</b> - Computer vision research for Toyota Motor Europe<br>
        2016 -- 2024<br>
        The Toyota Research Lab at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, CTU Prague<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Project: <b>SyRoTek</b> -- A Robotic System for Education<br>
        Systém pro Robotickou Tele-výuku (CZE)<br>
        2015 -- 2016<br>
        SyRoTek is a robotic e-learning platform designed to provide remote access to real mobile robots for educational purposes. I was involved in developing software modules that allowed students to control robots within a simulated arena from web application.
